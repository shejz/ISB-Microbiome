[Institute for Systems Biology (ISB)](https://isbscience.org/) A virtual course and symposium on the latest cutting edge microbiome research last October 2021 that highlight recent advances toward understanding general patterns of commensal population genomic variation within the human gut, how fine-scale commensal genomic variation is influenced by host phenotypic variation, and whether or not commensal genomic variation has an impact on human health and disease.

A symposium featuring six prominent microbiome researchers who are working to build computational and experimental tools for exploring rapid within-host bacterial evolution, and how these population genomic signatures may be related to ecosystem function, human phenotypic variation, or disease pathologies.


## Part 1: Amplicon Sequencing Data Analysis with QIIME 2 
- Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology [QIIME2](https://qiime2.org/).
- Amplicon sequencing data processing and analyses.

## Part 2: Metabolic Modeling of Bacterial Isolates
- Building genome-scale metabolic models for individual bacterial isolates to map genomic variation onto ecological niche space.
- Construct metabolic models from bacterial isolate sequencing data, and use those models to map commensal genomic variation to metabolic niche space.
