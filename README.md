# 2021 ISB Virtual Microbiome Series
Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) A virtual course and symposium on the latest cutting edge microbiome research.

ISB virtual course microbiome series events last October 13 - 15, 2021 that highlight recent advances toward understanding general patterns of commensal population genomic variation within the human gut, how fine-scale commensal genomic variation is influenced by host phenotypic variation, and whether or not commensal genomic variation has an impact on human health and disease.


## Part 1: Amplicon Sequencing Data Analysis with QIIME 2
- Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology [QIIME2](https://qiime2.org/).
- Amplicon sequencing data processing and analyses.


## Part 2: Metabolic Modeling of Bacterial Isolates
- Building genome-scale metabolic models for individual bacterial isolates to map genomic variation onto ecological niche space.
- Construct metabolic models from bacterial isolate sequencing data, and use those models to map commensal genomic variation to metabolic niche space.


A symposium featuring six prominent microbiome researchers who are working to build computational and experimental tools for exploring rapid within-host bacterial evolution, and how these population genomic signatures may be related to ecosystem function, human phenotypic variation, or disease pathologies.
